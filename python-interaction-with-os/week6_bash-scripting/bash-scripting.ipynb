    "#  Bash Scripting\n",
    "In this module, you’ll be exposed to what the Linux OS has to offer and you'll learn about Bash scripting. We’ll go over basic Linux commands and explore the many processes Linux has to offer, including a key concept called redirection. We’ll then deep dive into creating bash scripts using variables and globs. Finally, we’ll learn about advanced bash concepts and develop an understanding of when to use bash versus Python.\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Use basic Linux commands to work with files and directories\n",
    "- Create bash scripts and execute them\n",
    "- Execute scripts using variables and globs to influence the output of these scripts\n",
    "- Utilize while and for loops in bash scripts\n",
    "- Describe when it’s necessary to use Bash scripts over Python scripts"
