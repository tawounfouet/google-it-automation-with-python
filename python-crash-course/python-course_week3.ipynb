    "#### Anatomy of a While Loop\n",
    "A while loop will continuously execute code depending on the value of a condition. It begins with the keyword while, followed by a comparison to be evaluated, then a colon. On the next line is the code block to be executed, indented to the right. Similar to an if statement, the code in the body will only be executed if the comparison is evaluated to be true. What sets a while loop apart, however, is that this code block will keep executing as long as the evaluation statement is true. Once the statement is no longer true, the loop exits and the next line of code will be executed.  "

    "- One common mistake is to forget to initialize the variable used in the loop. This can lead to an infinite loop, which is a loop that never exits. If you accidentally write an infinite loop, your program will never complete, and you'll have to force it to quit. If you ever write a loop that you think should exit, but it doesn't, check to make sure that you initialized all of the variables you need to start the loop.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Let's try to forget to initialize the variable used in the loop\n",
    "while i <= 5:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i = i + 1\n",

    "NameError  Traceback (most recent call last)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another common mistake is to use the wrong comparison operator in the loop's condition. For example, say we want to count from 1 to 5, but we accidentally use the greater than or equal to operator instead of the less than or equal to operator. This loop would never start because the value of i is initially 1, and the loop condition checks if i is greater than or equal to 5. Since 1 is not greater than or equal to 5, the condition evaluates to False, and the loop never starts.\n",

This is the Python interpreter catching the mistake and telling you that you’re using an undefined variable. The fix is pretty simple: initialize the variable by assigning the variable a value before you use it.\n",

    "- `Unintended infinite loops`. Make sure that the body of the loop modifies the variables used in the condition, so that the loop will eventually end for all possible values of the variables. You can often prevent an infinite loop by using the break keyword or by adding end criteria to the condition part of the while loop.\n",

    "  print(x)\n",

    "Similar to if statements and while loops, for loops begin with the keyword for with a colon at the end of the line. Just like in function definitions, while loops and if statements, the body of the for loop begins on the next line and is indented to the right. But what about the stuff in between the for keyword and the colon? In our example, we’re using the range() function to create a sequence of numbers that our for loop can iterate over. In this case, our variable x points to the current element in the sequence as the for loop iterates over the sequence of numbers. Keep in mind that in Python and many programming languages, a range of numbers will start at 0, and the list of numbers generated will be one less than the provided value. So range(5) will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4, for a total of 5 numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bringing this all together, the range(5) function will create a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4. Our for loop will iterate over this sequence of numbers, one at a time, making the numbers accessible via the variable x and the code within our loop body will execute for each iteration through the sequence. So for the first loop, x will contain 0, the next loop, 1, and so on until it reaches 4. Once the end of the sequence comes up, the loop will exit and the code will continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of for loops comes from the fact that it can iterate over a sequence of any kind of data, not just a range of numbers. You can use for loops to iterate over a list of strings, such as usernames or lines in a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not sure whether to use a for loop or a while loop? Remember that a while loop is great for performing an action over and over until a condition has changed. A for loop works well when you want to iterate over a sequence of elements.  "

The range of numbers [0, 1, 2] correlates to ordinal index positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd), rather than the cardinal (quantity) values of the numbers 0, 1, and 2. For example, range(5) means the five index positions in the range [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. \n",
