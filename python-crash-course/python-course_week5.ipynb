    "\n",
    "In this module, you'll be introduced to the concept of object-oriented programming! You'll learn how to build your own classes with unique attributes and methods. You'll get a chance to write documentation for your classes and methods using docstrings. You'll learn all about object instances and object inheritance, as well as how to import and use Python modules to make use of powerful classes and methods. To round things out, you'll also be introduced to Jupyter notebooks, which we'll use to write and execute more complex code.\n",

    "\t\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, concepts are modeled as classes and objects. An idea is defined using a class, and an instance of this class is called an object. Almost everything in Python is an object, including strings, lists, dictionaries, and numbers. When we create a list in Python, we’re creating an object which is an instance of the list class, which represents the concept of a list. Classes also have attributes and methods associated with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Attributes are the characteristics of the class, while \n",
    "- Methods are functions that are part of of the class.\n",

    "We can use the type() function to figure out what class a variable or value belongs to. For example, type(\" \") tells us that this is a string class. The only attribute in this case is the string value, but there are a bunch of methods associated with the class. We've seen the upper() method, which returns the string in all uppercase, as well as isnumeric() which returns a boolean telling us whether or not the string is a number. You can use the dir() function to print all the attributes and methods of an object. Each string is an instance of the string class, having the same methods of the parent class. Since the content of the string is different, the methods will return different values. You can also use the help() function on an object, which will return the documentation for the corresponding class. This will show all the methods for the class, along with parameters the methods receive, types of return values, and a description of the methods."

    "#### What Is a Method?\n",
    "Calling methods on objects executes functions that operate on attributes of a specific instance of the class. This means that calling a method on a list, for example, only modifies that instance of a list, and not all lists globally. We can define methods within a class by creating functions inside the class definition. These instance methods can take a parameter called self which represents the instance the method is being executed on. This will allow you to access attributes of the instance using dot notation, like self.name, which will access the name attribute of that specific instance of the class object. When you have variables that contain different values for different instances, these are called instance variables."

    "##### Constructors and Other Special Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor of a class is a special method we use to initialize new instances of the class. In Python this method is the __init__ method, and it's typically used to set up attributes of the class instance. The __init__ method takes at least one argument, self, that refers to the object being created. This method must be called __init__ exactly, and it must be spelled correctly, with double underscores before and after the word init. Unlike other methods, the constructor will automatically get called when we create a new instance of the class, so we don't need to call it explicitly. The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class. It does not have to be named self, you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class. The word self is just a convention. The __init__ method can accept arguments other than self, but all other arguments will be passed when constructing the instance, and won't be passed when calling the class method on an existing instance. The __init__ method is a great place to do preprocessing, to make sure that your class variables have the proper initial values when an instance of the class is created. Another special method is the __str__ method, which is short for string; it's the method that gets called when we print an instance of the class, so we can return a string representation of the object. We can define the __str__ method within a class to determine how an instance of that class should be printed. The __str__ method takes one parameter, self, and must return a string."

    "#### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. The newly formed classes are called derived classes, the classes that we derive from are called base classes. Important benefits of inheritance are code reuse and reduction of complexity of a program. The derived classes (descendants) override or extend the functionality of base classes (ancestors). In this example, we have a base class Animal, which is inherited by the Dog class. The Dog class has a new method, bark, which overrides the same method in the base class. When the bark method is called on the Dog instance, Python looks for the method in the Dog class first, and executes that method. If it can't find such a method, it looks for it in the base class. Inheritance is a useful behavior that allows us to reuse and extend existing code without modifying it. This makes it easier to create and maintain applications."

    "\n",
    "Composition is another way to reuse code in Python or in object-oriented programming in general. We can use composition to combine objects of different classes, so that they refer to each other through their instance variables. In composition, we call methods of another class to do the work instead of doing it ourselves. This allows us to reuse the already existing code. In this example, we have a class called Salary that has an __init__ method that initializes two attributes, pay and bonus. The total method calculates the salary plus bonus. We then have an Employee class that has a __init__ method that initializes three attributes, name, age, and salary. The get_salary method calls the total method from the Salary class. We then create an instance of the Employee class, and call the get_salary method on that instance. This will return the total salary, which is calculated by calling the total method from the Salary class. This is an example of composition, where we use instances of other classes as attributes in our new class."
